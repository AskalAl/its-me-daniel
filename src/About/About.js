      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I spend my time building new websites and tools while simultaneously willing quirky side-projects into existence. I also have an unhealthy obsession with Elon Musk, I tend to impulsively learn new things for no apparent reason, and I think Indie music is pretty cool. When I'm not online, I can be found writing songs and acting on TV.</p>
      <p>I speak HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React
oh, also English and French</p>
    </section>
